Darlean is a library suite for distributed, concurrent programming. It provides the building blocks for writing scalable monoliths.

# Features

## Versatile library suite
Darlean is a versatile library suite designed to simplify language-interoperable, distributed, and concurrent programming. It currently includes a TypeScript library for Node.js, with libraries for .NET and Go scheduled for release in Q1 2024.

## Efficient development
Darlean’s integration of the actor model with built-in persistence significantly boosts programming efficiency. Whether you’re building scalable or regular solutions, it accelerates development cycles, reducing the time and effort required to bring software projects to market.

## Scalable primitives
One standout feature is its comprehensive set of scalable primitives — storage, tables, queues, web gateways, and more — empowering developers to create scalable applications with reduced external dependencies.

## Language interoperability
Darlean simplifies the integration of multiple programming languages within a single application. This is particularly valuable when working with polyglot teams or when leveraging different languages for specific components of a project.

# Concurrent programming
Darlean provides tools and abstractions for handling concurrency, making it easier to write applications that efficiently execute multiple tasks or processes concurrently without the risk of race conditions or out-of-order messaging issues.

# Reduced provider dependency
By minimizing dependencies on specific service providers or infrastructure, Darlean enhances flexibility and portability. Developers can build applications that are less tied to particular cloud platforms or vendors, reducing vendor lock-in and facilitating easier migration.

# Open source
It is our passion to bring the paradigm of actor-oriented programming to a wide audience, because we believe that software development and deployment can — and should — be simple, even for complex, scalable solutions. That is why we provide Darlean as an open source library.
